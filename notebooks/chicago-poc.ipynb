    "#### Common problems with systematic queries, coding, summarization of laws\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Time and expense (or limitations on what can be done given fixed headcount+budget)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Difficulty tracking and maintaining quality metrics\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Front-line staff (paralegals, junior lawyers, RAs) may want to work at higher level\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Need to specify queries up front\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Changes to queries **or** changes to underlying laws/documents require re-do\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Can large language models & embedding models help?\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM: _(system prompt, context, query) --> **magic** --> output_\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding model: _(text block) --> **magic** --> [.453436, .754757, ...]_\n",

    "1. Naive approach - present query directly to LLM (or chatbot interface), relying on parametric memory of training data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. (Probably) naive approach #2 - fine tune model on specialized data (might be helpful in conjunction with other ideas below)\n",

    "3. Naive approach #3 - Place hand-selected relevant sections of the local code into the LLM context window\n",

    "4. Use an off-the-shelf Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system to automate finding potentially-relevant context\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Make RAG better:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Custom document parser based on structure and semantics of code\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. collect related definitions, second-order info, etc. during parsing and include in context for final generation\n",
    "\n",
    "    c. Use LLM on retrieved outputs for reranking and filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "    d. For final generation, ask LLM to show steps (and other prompt engineering tricks)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    e. Provide reliable, retrieved citations and excerpts (explainability & verifiability)\n",

    "#### Some issues\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tech infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Access to ordinances\n",

      "==> Results for question: 4. What are the penalties for violating any such restrictions?\n",
      "The penalties for violating any restrictions outlined in the Chicago Code can\n",
      "vary depending on the specific violation. For instance, under Section 7-28-800,\n",
      "a person violating any provisions of the chapter may face a fine ranging from\n",
      "$250.00 to $500.00 for each offense, with each day of violation constituting a\n",
      "separate offense. Additionally, repeated violations at the same construction\n",
      "site within a specified period may lead to a stop work order issued by the\n",
      "department.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, under Section 7-32-045, individuals who violate smoking\n",
      "restrictions may face fines ranging from $100 to $250 for smoking in prohibited\n",
      "areas, while owners or operators of public places violating smoking provisions\n",
